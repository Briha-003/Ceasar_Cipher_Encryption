# Ceasar_Cipher_Encryption
This Java program implements the Caesar Cipher encryption technique, a simple substitution cipher, to encode a given input string by shifting each letter by a three positions in the alphabet.

# Overview
The program allows users to encrypt a given string by shifting each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while maintaining the case of the characters in the output. Non-alphabetic characters (symbols, numbers, spaces, etc.) remain unchanged in the encrypted text.

# How to Use
Running the Program
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java development environment or compile the Caesar_Cipher_Encryption.java file.
Run the program.
Enter the string you want to encrypt when prompted.
The program encrypts the input string using the Caesar Cipher technique with a fixed shift of 3 and displays the encrypted result.

# Example
Suppose you want to encrypt the string Hello, World!. Upon running the program, after providing this string as input, the program will output Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog! as the encrypted text.

# Usage Notes
The program uses the Scanner class to take user input for the string to be encrypted.
The default shift value is set to 3 for the Caesar Cipher encryption. You can modify the shift variable in the code to change the encryption strength.
Feel free to experiment with different strings and shift values to observe the encryption process using the Caesar Cipher.
